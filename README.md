### Description

This is a Form Fader OCX control. Simply stick it on a form, set a few properties, and with two lines of code it will fade-in and fade-out the form smoothly. Also lets you fade the form by setting a fading (opacity) factor between 25% and 100%. Semi-transparent forms can be moved across the background with a realistic transparent effect. The Fader can be compiled separately, of course. This OCX Control is based on code by Ed Preston (and he deserves the votes).
